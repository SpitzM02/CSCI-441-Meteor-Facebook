Project Notes:
-Replies to posts do work! I was able to get them functioning at a lower level
(I.E. component-by-component); meaning added replies do show up. However, because
the Tracker function automatically runs every time the database updates, Replies
are counted as their own posts and thus are styled/mapped as such. Also Replies
show up on every post which is a bug that I couldnt work out.

-There are checks in place to prevent negative likes on posts. All number of likes
stop at 0

-As a side note my collections are called RedditDB respectively because I originally
thought we were just building out a Reddit application


Impressive features:
- There is an extra collection called RedditDbUsers that stores only the users
that have registered for the site. The login bar on the application can add and
read users from the current database. The LoginBar component checks to see if a
registered user is in the database, and (if so) displays the current user logged
in. This was accomplished using react States with a default variable of 'undefined'
as the default user.

**note** there is nothing stored in the database as the app loads, you will have
to register a user to test it out
