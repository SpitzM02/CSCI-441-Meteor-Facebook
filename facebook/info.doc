Project Notes:
-Some of the components from the videos are switched around slightly- but that's
just to be able to do some of the extra stuff I added (detailed below)

-Replies to posts do work! I was able to get them functioning at a lower level
(I.E. component-by-component); meaning added replies do show up. However, because
the Tracker function automatically runs every time the database updates, Replies
are counted as their own posts and thus are styled/mapped as such.

Impressive features:
- There is an extra collection called RedditDbUsers that stores only the users
that have registered for the site. The login bar on the application can add and
read users from the current database. The LoginBar component checks to see if a
registered user is in the database, and (if so) displays the current user logged
in. This was accomplished using react States with a default variable of 'undefined'
as the default user.

**note** there is nothing stored in the database as the app loads, you will have
to register a user to test it out
